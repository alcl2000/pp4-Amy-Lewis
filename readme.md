## Site Development

This site was developed using the Django framework, to help wih development, I created a sitemap so that I could decide which features to implement on which page. This was important for developing templates, so I knew which pages to implement when

To better understand the mechanics of the database, I built a database schema to show the relations of the various tables and fields.

## Design Choices

The website was designed to be a bridge between retro true crime and conspiracy forums and modern micro forums like reddit. The conspiracy forums of the early internet were a gathering place for people with fringe ideas. They were often developed by people in their spare time and didnâ€™t necessarily have dedicated development UX/UI staff. The websites were hard to navigate but were a clear passion project for those involved. More modern sites like Reddit have sprung up as a response to web 2.0 and have been developed with users in mind. They provide a more user friendly and aesthetically appealing website, at the cost of the authenticity that the underground, less polished sites provided.

As this project is intended as an in-universe tie-in to the show yellowjackets, fonts and colours were picked from the show, to keep with the show. The show uses a dark colour palette to represent both the cult and conspiracy storylines within the show, and these were used across the site to help it feel more underground like the earlier sites.

Fonts were chosen mainly because of their spacing and simplicity to help with accessibility. Fira Sans Condensed is a sans-serif font which is well spaced and modern, but still looks similar to the typewriter fonts, which again speaks to the conspiracy at the heart of the show.

While the font 'Lobster Two' was chosen to add a design flair to the site and to match the promotional material of the show.
